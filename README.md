# LorSplit

LorSplit is a tool designed for generating **split-based images and videos** with customizable branching, speed, color, and complexity. The app allows users to control various parameters to create unique branching patterns dynamically.

## Features
- 🎨 **Dynamic Line Art Generation** – Generate branching patterns with adjustable complexity.
- ⚡ **Customizable Controls** – Modify parameters such as angle, thickness, speed, and split count.
- 🎥 **Video Recording Support** – Capture the drawing process as a video.
- 🖼️ **Image Export** – Save the final artwork as an image file.
- 🌈 **Color Selection** – Choose from a variety of predefined colors or pick a custom one.
